## Description
Intermediate level binary exploitation challenges.

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before jumping into this room, there are some prerequisites to complete the challenges:
- C programming language
- Assembly language (basics)
- Some experience in reverse engineering, using debuggers, understanding low-level concepts
- Python scripting and pwntools
- A lot of patience

These are the things you're going to learn in this room:
- Buffer overflow
- Modify variable's value
- Return to win
- Return to shellcode
- Integer Overflow
- Format string exploit
- Bypassing mitigations
- GOT overwrite
- Return to PLT
- Playing with ROP

I hope you enjoy this room. Keep an eye out for more binary exploitation challenges in my next room.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You're working with a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS VM, so there will be stack alignment issues, make sure to add a ret gadget to solve it.
