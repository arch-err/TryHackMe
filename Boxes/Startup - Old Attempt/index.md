We are Spice Hut, a new startup company that just made it big! We offer a
variety of spices and club sandwiches (in case you get hungry), but that is
not why you are here. To be truthful, we aren't sure if our developers know
what they are doing and our security concerns are rising. We ask that you
perform a thorough penetration test and try to own root. Good luck!
